It’s the perfect time to start a self-improvement or self-help blog: you have life experiences to share, you want to help others, and blogging platforms are user-friendly and free. There may be thousands of personal development, self-help and inspirational blogs but your story is unique. And we need to hear it. My tips for inspirational blogging are inspired by a writer who asked how to start a blog. One of the most important tips for any writer especially a self-help blogger is to stay as emotionally and spiritually healthy as possible."
